Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Prediction
This repository contains the code, datasets, and trained models for predicting Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions using machine learning techniques. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that occur across a company's value chain, accounting for 75-90% of total corporate emissions. This project aims to provide organizations with tools to better estimate and understand their Scope 3 emissions.

Project Overview
Scope 3 emissions are critical for understanding a companyâ€™s environmental impact but are challenging to measure due to:

Data inconsistencies

Lack of standardization

Complex value chains

To address these challenges, I developed machine learning models using real-world datasets and advanced algorithms to estimate Scope 3 emissions across 17 categories. These models help companies identify emission hotspots and take actionable steps toward sustainability.
